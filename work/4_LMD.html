    <div class="p x">
        Despite its long trend, the maker movement is not often followed by documentation it deserves. Commissioned by IDeATe, a community in CMY where all the cool stuff happens, we started to figure out the current practice of maker movement and documentation process. The project statement was to improve ideate gallery, an online documentation tool for IDeATe community.

     By researching with current users of IDeATe Gallery, we were able to find two insights that could lead to an effective redesign of the system.

    <div class="h2 x">Insight 1 - a gap between what users should have done vs. what they actually do
    </div>
    <div class="p x">
    The website was like a hall of fame - where users boast their works. The professors wanted it to look like that, but they also wanted it to be a safe place to practice the students' skills. The students reported that they spent too much extra time on making the documentation. The users of IDeATe website do not have their portfolio platform yet. They, however, wanted to put the projects done in IDeATe to their website in the future. 
    <br><br>
    From the interviews, we wanted to build a safe place where students hone their documentation skills and are ready to go to the pro field.

    <div class="h2 x">Insight 2 - the real value of a maker community
    </div>
    <div class="p x">
    The community has a diverse background, where everyone has expertise in one field and everyone can contribute to each others' works. The students take classes together and build team projects. Those classes intentionally accept the diverse background of people. The community ensures the quality of feedback, different from other forum-based websites like Stack Overflow or Quora. The community gives a sense of safety and belongingness. People also try more to answer the questions randomly asked by others when they are in the makerspace. 
    <br><br>
    From the literature reviews and observation, we wanted to transfer this sense of community and willingness to help in physical space into the virtual space.
