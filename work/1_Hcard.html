    The project goal was to 'design a search function within a monthly activity tab'. The tap shows a user's credit card usage during a certain month, including where, when and how much the person has paid with the card. First, I searched three existing banking applications, none of which had a search function specifically for a monthly spending. Well, that made sense, because usually search function is for a large amount of data. From the guerilla survey I conducted, the number of transactions per month ranged from 20 to 200. This is too small to be a search database.

   So, I stepped back and thought about why users would visit the particular tab, and if there was a search function what they would use it for. First of all, the information in the tab includes dates, amount, places, and accumulation of the amount. When would the users need these kinds of information?

<!--    One similar case I found was a photo managing application. It records the time and place of the event, and the events are grouped by time and place for their users. <br>-->

    After sharing insights with the team, I finalized the scenario to be identifying spending patterns. Users notice the overlaps in the places, and they want to use that information to find out their spending patterns and apply it for future savings.

    <div class="p x">
    It was a very exciting week that I got to solve a problem by researching and ideating. What I especially enjoyed was the opportunity to get industry-specific feedback from the designers who are working in the field. For example, you have to be very careful about the placement of recommendations,  since the application is about mobile banking, even if you recommend some benefits for the customers, they might think it is for the company's benefit. As a post side project,  I am making interactions for the application.
